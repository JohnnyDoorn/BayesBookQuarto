So far, we have discussed analyses that are fairly simple in terms of the number of parameters of interest. We specified different models that made different statements about values of this single parameter (e.g., $\theta$ for the binomial test, $\delta$ for the $t$-tests, or $\rho$ for the correlation), and conducted hypothesis tests by pairwise comparison of two models (e.g., @fig-beer-tastiness-correlation-posterior)
